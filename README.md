# Normal and pseudonormal numbers
In this repository one can find the code (namely, the Mathematica file) related to the paper "[On normal and pseudonormal numbers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05925)", written by Nicol√≤ Cangiotti and Daniele Taufer. In particular, we have developed a test to check if a number is normal (in the sense of Borel) or not. The normality test is based on the distribution of the difference between a given number and the number obtainded by swapping two of its digits. For firther detalis on this procedure please see the manuscript on arXiv (link above). Several examples of distribution are provided (number of digits: 100 000 000).
